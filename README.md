1. **Assignment_Bird_Boxes.ipynb** :- This notebook contains the code for object localization concept. It is explained using the dataset [CalTech-2010](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/). This is just the sample flow of how object localization works. In real-world, anyone can modify this code based on their requirement.
2. **Assignment_Zombie_Detector.ipynb** :- This notebook contains the code for modifying the RetinaNet architecture for single class and then restoring checkpoint . All steps are performed using **tensorflow** inbuilt functions to fine-tune classification layer on custom dataset of 5 images. 
3. **Assignment_Image_Segmentation_of_MNIST_Dataset.ipynb** :- This notebook contains the code that shows the implementation of the architecture for Image Segmentation model which includes downsampling and upsampling of the layers.
4. **Assignment_Saliency_Maps.ipynb** :- This notebook contains the code to perform the flow of how to get the Class Activation Maps highlighted on the image and also how the model classifies the images based on which pixels using saliency concept.
