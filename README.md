Soon, I'll be pushing some jupyter notebooks which will cover the basic concepts of Computer Vision.

1. **Assignment_Bird_Boxes.ipynb** :- This notebook contains the code for object localization concept. It is explained using the dataset [CalTech-2010](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/). This is just the sample flow of how object localization works. In real-world, anyone can modify this code based on their requirement.
